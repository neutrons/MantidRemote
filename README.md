MantidRemote
============

This is a Django project that handles the server-side work needed to allow Mantid to submit python scripts for execution on a compute cluster.

This project is designed specifically for the Fermi cluster at Oak Ridge National Lab, but may be useful (at least as a starting point) for other clusters at other institutions.

Protocol documentation is available at http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_JobSubmission_API
